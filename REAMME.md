#Learning Python & getting comfortable with using Git and GitHub

This is mainly a python learning repository with immplementation of Git & GitHub commands from VS code Termminal 

Iâ€™m an intermediate programmer, i already have some experience with many different languages but i never took a deep dive into a language. My FYP is going to be done using Python so this is why im starting from basics to fully comprehend the language and to make sure i understand everything it offers.
